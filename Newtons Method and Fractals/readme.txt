    Final project on Newtons method and the making of fractals.

    The goal of this project is to create fractals using Newtons Method

    Newtons Method is a way to algorithmically find roots of functions.

    Fractrals are produced when, given a starting point in Real numbers, you count how many steps Newtons Method takes to find a root. 
    If you map the number of steps to the starting point, an imagine can be created that will result in a fractal!

    This code here is how we decided to approach this process!
